create a new branch and switch to it at the same time, you can run the git checkout command with the -b switch:
$ git checkout -b BE09
Switched to a new branch "BE09"
This is shorthand for:
$ git branch BE09
$ git checkout BE09

Add the new files that you have created
$ git add .
or 
$ git add -A

commit changes on your branch$ git commit -m 'BE09 -added steps for collaboration'
$ git commit -m 'BE09 -added steps for collaboration'

push the branch that you just created to the remote repository
$ git push origin BE09

=========================
From here, go to github to the code repository.  You should see a green button indicating
that you can make a new pull request 'compare & pull request'
you want to request to merge your branch on to the main one
'create pull request'
once you create the pull request, someone else needs to review and approve it



=========================
The below steps will make it so that you are merging directly on to the main 
branch with no pull request
    ----- don't do that for this project, but you may want to for others
=========================
checkout the main branch so that you can compare your code to any other potentially updated
code to ensure no merge conflicts, or resolve those that do occur.
$ git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

merge your branch with the main branch
$ git merge BE09
